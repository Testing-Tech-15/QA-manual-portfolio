# Improvement Recommendation for [Getbot.ai](http://getbot.ai/) Portal: Search Icon Visibility

## Current Issue
The magnifying glass (search) icon in the Search field of the Getbot.ai portal is too small and visually detached from the text input area.  
Users may not immediately recognize it as part of the search function, sometimes leading to confusion or the search feature being overlooked.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Increase the icon size**  
   - Make the magnifying glass larger and more prominent so it clearly indicates the search function.

2. **Properly align the icon with the search field**  
   - Position the icon closer to the search input and visually integrate it with the field—either in-line, within the same block, or inside a single container.

3. **Maintain visual consistency with the portal design**  
   - Use the same style, color, and size as other UI elements to create a cohesive and polished look.

## Rationale for Recommendation
- The search function will become more noticeable and intuitive.  
- User confusion when identifying UI elements will be reduced.  
- Overall portal usability will improve, enhancing user satisfaction.  
- Ensures a consistent and professional visual design across the platform.

<summary>💡 Improvement Recommendation: File Upload Requires Prompt (Getbot.ai)</summary>

# File Upload Requires Prompt to Send, Causing System Error and Confusion

## Why this is a problem
When uploading a file on Getbot.ai, the file uploads successfully but is **not sent without entering a prompt**.  
Users may be unsure if the file has been sent, which can interrupt workflow—especially when the file itself represents a task or request.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Allow file sending without a prompt**  
   - Users should be able to send uploaded files without entering a prompt, enabling cases where the file alone represents the task or request.

2. **Fix “Send” button state handling**  
   - After sending, the “Send” button should return to its normal state and not remain in a spinning/loading mode.

3. **Improve error feedback**  
   - If a system error occurs, display a clear and temporary message without blocking the user from sending new files or prompts.

4. **Enhance large file processing stability**  
   - Optimize handling of files close to the maximum allowed size (50 MB) to prevent temporary system errors or unexpected UI behavior.

## Rationale for Recommendation
- Users can send files without unnecessary steps or confusion.  
- Prevents workflow interruptions caused by a spinning/loading button or system error messages.  
- Improves overall user experience and confidence in the platform.  
- Ensures reliable processing and consistent UI behavior for large files.
