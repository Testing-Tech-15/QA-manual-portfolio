## Description

### Current Issue
- In the login process ("Continue using email"), users **cannot see what they type** in the password field.  
- The same applies to the password confirmation field.  
- Lack of visual feedback increases the chance of errors, slows down fixing issues, and can make registration or login more difficult.  

### Recommendation
- Add a **show/hide (eye) button** to the password fields.  
- When the user clicks the eye icon:  
  - The password becomes visible  
  - Clicking again hides it  

**Benefit:**  
- Provides immediate visual feedback  
- Reduces errors and frustration  
- Improves overall user experience during registration and login

## Example Behavior
1. User types a password in the field  
2. User clicks the eye icon → password becomes visible  
3. User clicks again → password is hidden
